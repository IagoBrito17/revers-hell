# rever's-hell
__*An open-source Python reverse shell and keylogger (soon) based on [Turtle Reverse Shell](https://github.com/buckyroberts/Turtle)*__

Feel free to help me to build this project :D

# Usage
You first need to configure the IP addresses and ports that will be used to run the shell.
After that, run `rever_server.py` on the hosting machine and `rever_client.py` on the machine that
will be accessed by the shell.

# Commands
* `list`: Lists all the open connections
* `select`: Selects a client given its ID
* `join`: Joins the selected client session

# Notes
Some commands might not work. If it happens, please report the issue.
